		<h2 style="text-align: center;"><u>WELCOME TO KABANA WOMEN FARMERS</h2></u><br></br>
		<br></br>
		<p>Our projects in Uganda offer a wide range of support.From helping coffee farmers in the western region to engage with markets, to enabling small-scale chilli growers in the northern region to capitalize on the sector's huge market demand, to supporting pastoralist women set up sustainable goat-rearing enterprises.</p>
		<p>We help farmers find ways of  earning a livingthat are suited to their natural environment, so they can improve their lives without damaging the natural resources they rely on.</p>
		<p>We also support rural communities so they can have more of a voice in shaping the policies that affect their lives.</p>
		<p>Kabana women farmers deal in a variety of foods and crops as shown below in our Menu;</p>

		<p>On 1st October 2022, the KABANA WOMEN FARMERS , in partnership with the German Association of Rural Women Farmers, flagged 20 women farmers to the Federal Republic of Germany for a 10-day exposure, learning, and knowlegde-sharing expedition.While in Germary,the team will be able to visit fellow rural women farmers in frankfurt, and neighbouring areas. This is one of the initiatives under the project to strengthen Rural Women Farmers' involvement in Strategic Agricultural- related Activities(SWISA)implemented in District Farmers' Associations across the country</p>

		<p>It should be noted that women play a critical and potentially transformative role in agricultural growth and substainable development however, recent studies by the food and Agricultural Organisation(FAO) indicate that the contribution of women to agricultural and food production is significant but it is impossible to verify empirically the share produced by women.</p>
		<p>KABANA WOMEN FARMERS and its partners hope that such exposure, learning and knowledge-sharing visits will provide a platform where women can develop initiatives that are geared at helping them overcome the persistent obstacles and economic constraints limiting their further inclusion in the agricultural sector.</p>
